    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cornbread dressing recipe is from my grandmother. She loved to make it for holiday dinners and for family gatherings other times of the year. Use your favorite cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</p>

        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried sage, or more to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
